# Hand Gestures Controlled Goods Gripper

In the modern world the field of technology is making tremendous progress. In that sense,consumers in Sri Lanka are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain high-end products inshops. In many cases ladders and rods are used to retrieve items that are stacked high. Inaddition, high-altitude objects are more likely to fall down and be damaged if they are not takensafely. 
Many of these problems are caused by this and our team decided to create hand gesturecontrolled goods gripper as a solution. This allows you to pick up high-end products in shopsfrom where customers are, this allows the products to be obtained easily and efficiently in abrief time without being damaged while being picked up. We hope hand gesture-controlledgoods gripper will be a better solution to such problems in shops. Many of these problems arecaused by this and our team decided to create hand gesture-controlled goods gripper as asolution. This allows you to pick up high-end products in shops from where customers are, thisallows the products to be obtained easily and efficiently in a brief time without being damagedwhile being picked up. 
We are hoping that hand gesture-controlled goods gripper will be a better solution to such problems in shops. By creating this it can be used in all shops in general.We fully believe that shop employees and customers will benefit from using this.

# Aim
Design and develop a robotic arm to function similar to the human arm and control it by our arm simulations. 

# Objectives
#####  To take things easily from standing in the ground from the higher place.
##### To get the items safely and prevent items has been damaged.
##### To help the special need person to get things.
#####  To reduce time for getting things in a higher place.
#####  To reduce the numbers of workers.
#####  To arrange a reasonable number of things on goods racks.
#####  To prevent the goods from collapse.

# Overall Brief Description

As the solution to this problem, we decided to make hand gesture-controlled goods gripper.
This arm helps to pick things easily from standing in the ground to the higher place. Goods
gripper’s movements are similar to the human’s arm system. We can control the system by our
hand gestures. The system has two main physically in-depended sections. They are the
moveable arm section which is shown in figure no: -04 and glove control section (figure no: -
08). The glove control section will work as a controller, and it will control the whole arm
section. The arm section has three sub sections. They are horizontal arm, vertical arm, and the
gripper arm (figure no: -04). The horizontal arm is attached to the track and the horizontal arm
can be able to move horizontally (left to right). The stepper motor will help the arm to move
horizontally. The vertical arm is attached to the horizontal arm, and it can move vertically (updown) with the processes of stepper motor which are shown in figure no 5. By the movements
of these two arm sections, the arm section can move any place of the goods stacked track. The
other arm is Gripper arm which is shown in figure no 6 and it like human’s hand. This gripper
arm is attached to the vertical arm. This can be able to move to any place in a specific area.
Those three arms can be controlled by hand gestures.
Unlike horizontal and vertical arm, the gripper arm has a special section called gripper
(figure no 7). This gripper can be able to grab any object in the track. The gripper is controlled
by finger gestures using our thumb and index fingers. This gripper has a pressure sensor and
an ultrasonic sensor. These sensors will improve the effectiveness of the gripper while picking
the object. Servo motors will help the gripper arm to move and grab the objects.
The other main section is glove controller. This is a wearable glove. This has two flex
sensors and a gyroscope accelerometer sensor. This is the controller of the whole arm section.
Gyroscope accelerometer is used to control the horizontal, vertical, and griper arm at the same
time The flex sensors are used to control the gripper. By doing the hand and finger gestures the
sensor values will be mapped to arm section’s movements.
